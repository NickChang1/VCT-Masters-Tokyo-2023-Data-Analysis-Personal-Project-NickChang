This project is finding out the difference stats between each professional valorant player as well as what really does correlate to a round win or a round loss by looking at headshot percentages and KAST. 
I couldn't use the vlr.gg API for the overall stats of each player, so I made the dataset on my own by copying them down including the rounds win and loss.
I wrote this by using the Kaggle Notebook, Python/Pandas/Seaborn/Matplot.
When I created this program, I had a bit of a hard time getting familiar with pandas, seaborn, matplot and getting the csv file to read correctly and also just a bit of other small bug fixes.
